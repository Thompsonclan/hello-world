# hello-world
Hello Everyone. None of you may know who I am. I am Brandon Thompson. I am 27 years old and attending university, pursuing a B.S. and M.S. in Data Analytics. As of now, I am trying to enter the field of data science as a data scientist. I am a veteran of the United States Navy; I served a single tour into the Middle East. While I was stationed in the USN, I was an aviation electrician. This was my proper trial by fire with electronics in general. I joined the military out of high school with little to no skills. Once in the military, I worked as an aviation electrician daily. This career introduced me to the field of computer science. Well, I fell in love with learning coding languages. During my time in the military, I could master Python and SQL to enter this field. Please don't hesitate to give me advice or reach out for collaboration. I am always willing to learn and will help with any project if you take me under your wing.
